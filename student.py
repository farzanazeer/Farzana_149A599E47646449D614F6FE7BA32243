#Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student objects as input and sorts the list based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order. Each student object has the following attributes: name (string), roll_number (string), and cgpa (float). Test the function with different input lists of students.

class student:
  def__init__(self,name,rol_number,cgpa)
     self.name = Name
     self.roll_number = roll-number
     self.cgpa =cgpa

  def sort_students(student_list):
    sorted_students = sorted(student_list,key = lambda student.cgpa,reverse =True)
    return sorted_students
students = [student("Hari","A123",7.8),
            student("srikanth","A124",8.9),
            student("saumya","A125",9.1),
            student("Mahidhar","A126",9.9),
           ]
sorted_students = sort_students(students)
for student in sorted_students:
  print("Name:{},Roll number:{},cgpa:class student:
